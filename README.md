**🧠 Why it works?**

Overcoming Time Blindness:

* Instead of abstract digital numbers, the timer uses a red sector that physically shrinks over time. This allows your brain to instantly "see" how much time is left, reducing anxiety and urgency paralysis.

* Neuro-Audio for Concentration:

**Built-in "color noise" generator:**

* Brown Noise: A deep, low-frequency hum that is perfect for "drowning out" the internal chaos of thoughts.

* Pink & White Noise: To block out external distracting sounds.

* Binaural Beats ("Flow"): A specific frequency designed to help your brain enter a state of deep work (Theta waves).

**Gamification without Stress:**

Track your progress unobtrusively. Unlock achievements for your first steps and focus marathons. All statistics are stored locally on your device.

**✨ Key Features:**

✅ Completely Free & Open Source: No ads, no in-app purchases.

✅ Minimalist Dark Interface: Easy on the eyes and free of distracting bright elements.

✅ Offline Mode: Works without an internet connection.
